                Back in 2021, Dr. Yoon and I had a vision. We wanted to create an implant academy where we can share our knowledge and passion with our fellow dentists.
              </p>
              <p>
                We felt that our strength was on live surgery, so on Nov 2021, we formed our very first live surgery study club with 12 doctors. Basically 6 of my friends and 6 of his friends who had nothing better to do.
              </p>
              <p>
                Doctors would bring their own patients to place implants. We go over the cases in our waiting areas or staff rooms which got converted into classrooms.
              </p>
              <p>
                Surgery time was busy. Doctors would be paired up for the day and take turns performing and assisting the surgery. Occasionally, Stephen and I would step in to demonstrate certain techniques.
              </p>
              <p>
                Over the years, Stephen and I helped doctors placing their first implants, first PRFs, or even first lateral sinus lifts.
              </p>
              <p>
                But as time went on, doctors were asking for us to run various lectures so they can learn more details and expand their scope within implant dentistry.

                    So on May 2023, we began collaborating with HiOssen AIC and started teaching the 8-day implant residency which includes 2 days of live surgery.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    We understand that time for the courses meant time away from your practice and family & friends. So we wanted to deliver as much information in the least number of days possible.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In order to make that possible, we have fully printed notes where you can review at home as needed.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Our ultimate goal is to allow you to go back to your clinics and be able to apply the knowledge you've gained to your practice. In order to do that, hands-on learning is so crucial. We are proud to say that our residency has hands-on learning on every single day.

                    A big part of our WISE and HiOssen's culture is to allow doctors to network with one another. And what better way is there than to do it over food and some drinks?

                    Our highlight in our career and implant education is being on the PDC live stage surgery. The PDC scientific committee wanted us to target beginner implantologists since we are new to the PDC stage. But of course, what fun would it be if we spend an hour and a half placing one simple implant?
